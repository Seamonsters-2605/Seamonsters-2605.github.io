**Challenge:** Make a virtual robot follow a path.

Open the Seamonsters Template in VS Code and checkout to the practice-autonomous branch by typing this in the terminal:

```
git checkout practice-autonomous
```

In VS Code, click the Debug icon on the left side (the no-bug icon). At the top of the panel, the configuration should be set to "Simulate Robot." Click the green play button next to this.

You will see the robot simulator with a green line drawn on the field. You can click the "Autonomous" button to run the robot (nothing will happen right now because there is no robot code).

You will need to edit `robot.py` to make the robot follow the green line. You can use the [Robot Programming Reference](../reference/) page as a reference.
